# About the Project: Secret Auction
I have developed a straightforward secret auction program in Python that allows users to participate by entering their names and bids. The program validates input, ensuring that bids are numeric, and it keeps track of the bidders and their respective bids. The winner is determined by comparing the bids, and the program concludes by announcing the winning bidder with the highest bid. The user experience is enhanced with a visually appealing ASCII art logo, and credits acknowledge the creator of the program.
